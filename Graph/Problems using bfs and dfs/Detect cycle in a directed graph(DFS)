/* 

We will have a visited and pathVisited array 

We check from 0 to V ..... if we get visited[i]=false then call the dfs for that node

In dfs function what we are doing is just 
        At first mark both the array as visited
        
        Then iterating throuhg the current nodes adj list if that node is unvisited then 
        call the dfs and so on
        And keep in mind whenever at the time of return of any recursion make sure to unvsited 
        the pathVistied array cause now you are not on that path
        
        And if anytime you encountered a situation where the node is visited and the pathVisited 
        array is also visited, it means there is a cycle for sure..cause you started from that 
        node now again you are on the node in a path
